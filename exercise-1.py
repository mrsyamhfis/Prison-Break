# Task: Complete the follwing steps as instructed.

arr_1 = [3, 5, 22, 5,  7,  2,  45, 75, 89, 21, 2]; # --> 276
arr_2 = [9, 2, 42, 55, 71, 22, 4,  5,  90, 25, 26]; # --> 351


# Step 1: Calculate the sum of arr_1 and store in a variable "sum1"
# Add your code below:

i = 0
sum1 = 0
while (i < len(arr_1)):  # to refer to the total index which is 10 (<11)
    sum1 += arr_1[i]
    i = i + 1

# Step 2: Calculate the sum of arr_2 and store in a variable "sum2"
# Add your code below:

i = 0
sum2 = 0
while (i < len (arr_2)):
    sum2 += arr_2[i]
    i = i + 1


# Step 3: Print out the sum of the 2 arrays
# Add your code below:

print (sum1 + sum2)


# Step 4: Calculate the difference of sum of the two array
# Tricky Part: the difference should be a positive number
# sum of arr_1 could be larger or smaller than sum of arr_2
# Tips: use an if statement to handle the tricky part
# Add your code below:


if sum1 < sum2:
    print(sum2 - sum1)

if sum1 > sum2:
    print(sum1 - sum2)


    
    


# Expected Output: 
# 627
# 75
